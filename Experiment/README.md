## Overview:
In this folder, we demonstrate the experimental part of our project.

---
## Files:

- `ADMM_comparision.ipynb`:Compared several methods with our method. All of these methods are based on the ADMM algorithm and their outcome varies.
- `tf_for_graph`: Plot the grouping outcome for B=1,2,3.
- `experiment_1`: Show the Monte Carlo experiment and the code of image denoising.
- `ADMM_FN_for_tf.ipynb`: Demonstrates methods from the referenced paper (ADMM on graphs, Fast Newton) and plots the loss for both the primal and dual problems.
