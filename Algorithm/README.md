- This folder contains the algorithm part of our project. 

- While using the algorithm in `doge_admm.py` or `tfgraph.py`, note that the file must be placed in the same folder.
---

- `doge-admm.py`: contains the main part of our algorithm and some other algorithms, including GTF ADMM, Fast ADMM, Original ADMM.
- `tfgraph.py`: contains our grouping code and code for generating differential operator $\Delta$. Moreover there are also some other algorithms, including Fast Newton and a fast ADMM for TVmodel.
